# 2D Chart Creator
This project is written in SDL2 library. 
It takes mathematical functions [f(x)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) and presents it on the coordinate system.

# Requirements
The project requires SDL2 library. If you don't have it, use [brew](https://brew.sh/).
```bash
brew install sdl2
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If user want to use own function, code has the function called mFunc, inside this function user is able to change everything.

## Usage
### Use W and S keys for increasnig/decreasing the size of cells on the coordinate system.
### Use E and D for changing the quality of the resulting function (clearly, it changes the number of displaying pixels on the screen).
### Use R for creating the reflection of the final function.
